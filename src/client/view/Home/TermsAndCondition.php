                            <p>These Terms may be updated from time to time. If we believe that the changes are significant to your knowledge, we’ll surely let you know by doing one or more of the following: posting the changes through the Services or sending you an email or message about the changes. That way you can decide whether you want to continue using the Services. Changes will be effective upon the posting of the changes. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. Your use of the Services following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

                            <p>We wouldn’t like to see you go, but to terminate your account with NaijaSub, you may simply stop using our services at any time. Terminating your account will not affect the availability of some of Your Content that you posted through the Services prior to termination. And yes, you’ll still have to pay any outstanding bills.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We may also terminate or suspend your account, any related accounts and your access to the Services at any time, for any reason, and without advance notice. If we do so, it’s important to understand that you don’t have a contractual or legal right to continue using our Services, for example, to sell or buy on our sites and others. NaijaSub may refuse service to anyone, at any time, for any reason. If you or NaijaSub terminates your account, you may lose any information associated with your account, including Your Content.
